# Pre-Commit Checklist: Event Loop Lock Fix

## âœ… Code Changes
- [x] Modified `RateLimiter` class in `src/llm_query_doc_analyser/utils/http.py`
  - [x] Added `_loop` tracking attribute
  - [x] Enhanced `_ensure_lock()` to detect event loop changes
  - [x] Recreates lock when event loop differs
  - [x] Added comprehensive docstrings

## âœ… Testing
- [x] All existing tests pass (30/30)
- [x] New tests added in `tests/test_rate_limiter.py`:
  - [x] `test_rate_limiter_basic()` - Basic functionality
  - [x] `test_rate_limiter_multiple_event_loops()` - Within same loop
  - [x] `test_rate_limiter_across_asyncio_run_calls()` - **Critical test for the bug**
  - [x] `test_rate_limiter_concurrent_access()` - Thread safety
  - [x] `test_rate_limiter_lazy_lock_initialization()` - Lazy init
- [x] Type checking passes (mypy)

## âœ… Documentation
- [x] Created `docs/bugfix_event_loop_lock.md` - Detailed technical doc
- [x] Created `docs/event_loop_lock_recreation_diagram.md` - Visual explanation
- [x] Created `docs/BUGFIX_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md` - Executive summary
- [x] All docs include:
  - [x] Problem statement
  - [x] Root cause analysis
  - [x] Solution details
  - [x] Code examples
  - [x] Test coverage

## âœ… Verification Steps
- [x] Unit tests pass
- [x] Integration scenario tested (multiple `asyncio.run()` calls)
- [x] No regression in existing functionality
- [x] Type annotations correct

## âœ… Impact Assessment
- [x] **Fixes**: Second enrichment pass crashes
- [x] **No breaking changes**: Fully backward compatible
- [x] **Performance**: No negative impact
- [x] **Scope**: Isolated to `RateLimiter` class

## ðŸ“‹ Suggested Commit Message

```
fix: Handle event loop changes in RateLimiter for multi-pass enrichment

Fixes crash during second enrichment pass (published version enrichment)
caused by asyncio.Lock objects bound to a different event loop.

Changes:
- Track event loop ownership in RateLimiter._loop
- Recreate locks when event loop changes (e.g., multiple asyncio.run() calls)
- Add comprehensive tests for event loop switching scenarios

Impact:
- Second enrichment pass now works correctly
- No breaking changes
- Fully backward compatible

Tests: 30/30 passing (5 new tests added)
Docs: Added comprehensive documentation and diagrams
```
